# IIA-Ontology-about-Watches-Vigier
Web Ontology Language (OWL). For this ontology work we decided to take watches, took a set of features, 
created instances that exemplify the features and generated a set of relevant queries. 
Watches are modeled to help the user understand the features and types of watches that their customers may want.
